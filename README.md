# Gitlab Demo

Thanks to Lara Ianov of UAB. Forked from https://gitlab.rc.uab.edu/lianov/gitlab_demo

#### Sample documentation page

Accepts markdown syntax such as `this`. FYI, click [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for a markdown cheat sheet if you are unfamiliar. If you truly want your research to be reproducible, a good documentation page is a __must__!

The `GitLab_presentation.pdf` contains the slides I will show. However, a good section of this presentation will be shown from a live demostration since showing GitLab's graphical interface and an intro to the git commands are the goals of this talk.

The script `demo.sh` is just a mock-up script. The purpose is just to show the git features that will be discussed in the presentation: GitLab groups, `clone`, `commit` (the several ways of doing this), `push`, `branch`, and the interpretation of git's history within the repo. May touch upon other features such as `fork`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`,`git tag` etc..., but very broadly due to time.
